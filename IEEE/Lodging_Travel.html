	<h2>Transportation</h2>
	<p>Banff is only 90-minutes from Calgary International Airport, and is easily accessible by rental car, the Banff Airporter,or the Brewster Banff Airport Express.</p>
	<p>Banff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta. The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east-west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north-south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.

Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.</p>

	<h2>Tourism</h2>
	<p>
Banff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually.Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy.

A park pass is required for stopping in the park and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.
</p>
    <p>Banff is also famous for its night life. It has plenty of night clubs and bars around.

The month of May is also beginning of spring, there are loads of outdoor activities which can be done and it is the perfect weather to check out the incredible mountain tracks and amazing wildlife.

You can take a walk around the town's narrow lanes, take a historic tour or go for a hike around the mountains to explore nature at its best. The weather is still a bit cold for camping though.

During this month, there is also the Banff to Calgary Road Race; a fundraising event that raises money for the Theatre Calgary. Over 100 teams run 88 miles for the event.

From mid May in Banff, there is the Children's Festival which hosts a variety of entertainment for the whole family, including storytelling, puppets, dances and juggling.</p>
